## California local government civic profile system for CPC
Based on the California Credit Scoring System originally developed by Public Sector Credit  Solutions.

By integrating data from audited financial statements, TransparentCalifornia, state sources and federal
sources, the new profile system will provide California citizens with an unprecedented level of insight 
into the operations of their local agencies. The array of data will allow users to identify “problem 
governments” and hold the elected officials of these agencies accountable.

### Functionality

The system will allow users to select a local government by entering its name or choosing it from a map.  
The map will have three modes: (1) cities and counties, (2) school districts and (3) special districts.  This 
will limit cases in which dots overlap on the map display.

Once a local government is selected, the user will be presented with a multiple tab interface providing 
data for the entity.  Where appropriate, we will show data points together with rankings so that users 
can see how their agency stacks up against others.
